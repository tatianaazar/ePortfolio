        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>I am a driven and passionate software engineering graduate with a strong foundation in full-stack development. This fall, I will be advancing my expertise by pursuing a Masterâ€™s in Data Science, where I aim to merge my software engineering skills with advanced analytical techniques to drive impactful solutions in the tech industry.</p>
    <br>
    <p>Over the past year, I have had the unique opportunity to spearhead the development of a comprehensive tech stack for an ambitious startup that is on the verge of launching. As the sole developer, I have been responsible for the end-to-end development process, demonstrating my ability to manage and deliver a complete product. I have utilized React Native and TypeScript to create a responsive and intuitive frontend, while leveraging Node.js for a scalable backend infrastructure. MongoDB has been my choice for database management, ensuring that the application can handle dynamic data efficiently.</p>
    <br>
    <p>In addition to my work at the startup, I also had the rewarding experience of collaborating on a group project to develop a medical symptom classifier. This project was particularly exciting and educational, as I was tasked with implementing a machine learning algorithm to analyze a vast 400-page dataset. I successfully implemented a depth-first search Naive Bayes algorithm, which could accurately classify symptoms and provide primary, secondary, and tertiary classifications when possible. This project not only deepened my understanding of machine learning but also reinforced my passion for solving complex problems through innovative technology.</p>
    <br>
    <p>My experience also includes integrating various third-party APIs, such as Google, Facebook, and Apple sign-in, which has enhanced my understanding of secure authentication processes and user experience optimization. Through these roles, I have honed my problem-solving skills, learned to adapt quickly to new technologies, and developed a deep passion for building products that are both functional and user-centric.</p>
    <br>
    <p>I am excited about the prospect of bringing my technical skills, my dedication to continuous learning, and my enthusiasm for innovation to a dynamic team. I am eager to contribute to projects that challenge me and allow me to grow, while also making a meaningful impact on the organization and its users. As I continue my journey in data science, I am confident that my background in software engineering and machine learning will enable me to bridge the gap between software development and data-driven decision-making, driving success in future endeavors.    </p>
