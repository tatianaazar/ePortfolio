        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hello! I have just graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering. I have a deep passion for Web and Mobile Applications Development and Engineering, and am highly intrigued by Machine Learning and Data Science.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am starting my Master's degree in Data Science this fall 2024, and I couldn't be more excited!</p>
        <br>
        <p>For more about me and my projects, please check my About page :)</p>

        <h2>My Latest (and Most Exciting) Project!</h2>
        <p>Since February 2024, I have been working with my team to develop LAYLATI.</p>
        <br>
        <p>LAYLATI is an event planning platform that allows users to find and book vendors and coordinate their dream event. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Since we are a very small startup and have not yet launched, I am the primary and sole developer developing the Mobile Application. (This makes me the CTO and co-founder, which places me in a very tough and demanding position).
        </p>
